Flood Relief : Emergency Relocation and Healthcare System for Flood Victims  
  
We have proposed and implemented an Emergency Relocation and healthcare system using an online/offline android application for helping flood victims to get emergency resources , food , healthcare and relocation facilities.  
  
Some of the most useful features of our Android application are:  

-Offline SOS functionality to send SOS to nearby helplines during danger. 
-Relocation functionalities with list of safer areas nearby along with directions on Maps.  
-Emergency Healthcare Facility to order medicines , first-aid , resources , food and ambulance in case of a fatal injury during floods.   
-Easy login for new NGOs, helplines , rescuers since App is not exclusive to any organization i.e. any new rescuing team coming in area can easily access SOS and healthcare requests coming from that area.    
-Funding system for people in safer areas to directly fund helplines in front to help people stuck in flood prone areas.  

The Project is currently in development Phase.
